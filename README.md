# Burger

This application is essentially a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Access the application on Heroku here: https://calm-river-18207.herokuapp.com/.
